# Product Overview & Vision

## Product Name

State-Aware Pentest Notebook (working title)

## Problem Statement

Pentesters juggle scattered notes, tools, and mental checklists during engagements. Existing note tools are passive and unaware of engagement context, causing missed steps, inefficiency, and inconsistent methodology.

## Solution

A **state-aware pentest notebook** that combines reusable knowledge with engagement-specific execution tracking, and proactively suggests next steps based on current context.

## Core Principles

* Human-in-the-loop (never auto-hack)
* Deterministic and explainable
* Methodology-driven (OWASP-aligned)
* Local-first and secure

## Target Users

* Professional penetration testers
* Junior pentesters learning methodology
* Red team operators needing structured execution

## Core Foundations

1. Knowledge Base – reusable pentesting knowledge
2. Execution Base – engagement-specific case files

## What Makes This Different

* Engagement state awareness
* Methodology-driven suggestions
* Explicit phase tracking
* Rule-based, auditable logic
