# Engagement & State Model

## Engagement Purpose

Represents a single pentesting assessment and its current state.

## Engagement Data

* id
* name
* targets (IP/hosts)
* open ports
* services
* current phase
* findings

## Methodology Phases

1. Reconnaissance
2. Enumeration
3. Exploitation
4. Post-Exploitation

## State Characteristics

* Phase is explicitly set by user
* Findings are phase-scoped
* Services are inferred from ports

## State Awareness

State is derived from:

* Current phase
* Known services
* Findings count and tags

The system never assumes compromise or success.
